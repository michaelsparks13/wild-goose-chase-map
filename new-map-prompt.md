Prompt for New Maps
Save this to start new projects:


Build an interactive race map for: [RACE URL]

Follow the workflow in CLAUDE.md. Create the map in /maps/[race-name]/
and add it to the landing page index.html when complete.

Race type: [road / trail / multi-loop / point-to-point]

GPX available: [Yes / No / Unknown]
If yes, note where: [e.g., "Download button on race page", "Strava route link", etc.]

IMPORTANT: Visit the race organizer's website and match the map's UI to their
branding — colors, fonts, and visual style. The map should look like a natural
extension of their site.

After build completion, start a local server (npx serve -l 3000) so I can test.
